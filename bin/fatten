#ABSTRACT: Produce Perl script that only depends on core modules
#PODNAME: fatpack-noncore

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # by default targets current perl version and outputs to SCRIPT.packed
 % fatpack-noncore bin/script.pl

 # set target perl version, set output file, see debug logs
 % fatpack-noncore --perl-version v5.10.1 -o /tmp/script.pl --debug bin/script.pl

 # see more options
 % fatpack-noncore --help


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is a wrapper around L<fatpack>. It aims to produce a packed script
that can run on a stock Perl installation that has only core modules. Thus, it
packs all non-core modules required by the script.


=head1 TODO/ISSUES

=over

=item * 'fatpack trace' doesn't give minimum version of required modules

Perhaps alternatively use L<Perl::PrereqScanner> or something like?

=item * Hasn't handled the case of modules that are core in an earlier version of perl but become non-core in a later version

=back
