#ABSTRACT: Pack your dependencies onto your script file
#PODNAME: fatten

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # by default outputs to 'packed' in the current directory
 % fatten bin/script.pl

 # some options (set debug, set target perl version, add some modules, set output)

 # see more options
 % fatten --help


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<fatten> is an alternative command-line script for L<App::FatPacker>.
Differences with the B<fatpack> script that comes with App::FatPacker:

=over

=item * A simpler interface and some nice defaults

Currently B<fatten> ignores C<fatlib/> and XS modules. It only focuses on
creating free-standing Perl script which depends on pure-Perl modules (C<.pm>
files) only. Including C<fatlib/> to a stand-alone script will require an
approach like L<PAR::Archive> (i.e. bundling the required files in an archive
and extracting the required files on the temporary directory).

By default B<fatten> skips core modules.

B<fatpack> sometimes fails to include some modules because it can't find the
C<.packlist> said modules. B<fatten> goes ahead and tries the next best thing
which is to copy just the C<.pm> files.

=item * Alternative methods to trace script's dependencies

Aside from the default `fatpack trace` method, it can also use
L<Perl::PrereqScanner> and others. See L<App::tracepm> for more details.

=item * Some extra options

Like an option to strip the modules with L<Perl::Stripper>.

L<App::FatPacker>

For producing free-standing Perl scripts/applications, there are other
alternatives like L<PAR::Packer> (can also pack XS modules and compress the
included files in a special archive, but with higher startup time and temporary
directory to extract stuffs).

L<Perl::Stripper>
