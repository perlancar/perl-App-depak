#ABSTRACT:

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Basic usage (input & output):

 # by default outputs to '<script>.fatpack' in the source directory, or in
 # current directory if source directory is not writable.
 % fatten bin/script.pl

 # specify output path
 % fatten bin/script.pl -o /tmp/script.pl

 # output to stdout
 % fatten bin/script.pl -o -

 # input from stdin (output will default to stdout, unless you give -o)
 % download-perl-script | fatten

 # see debug messages (what modules are being traced and included, etc)
 % fatten --debug <script.pl >script.fatpack

Including and excluding modules:

 # add some more modules not detected by the tracer
 % fatten -I Foo::Bar -I Foo::Baz bin/script.pl -o script.fatpack

 # change trace method, usually 'require' will give pretty complete result
 % fatten -t require <script.pl >script.fatpack

 # don't trace modules from script, but include all modules found under 'fatlib'
 % fatten -t none --include-from fatlib bin/script.pl -o script.fatpack

 % fatten --help


=head1 DESCRIPTION

 "Thank you for a freakin awesome app. Seriously, fatten is great! <3"
 -- Paul J. Fenwick

B<fatten> is an alternative command-line script for L<App::FatPacker>. I had a
few problems when using the B<fatpack> script which comes with
C<App::FatPacker>, namely: 1) using B<fatpack> to produce a fatpacked-script is
a multistep process and I always forget the steps; 2) some modules that ought to
be included are often not included; 3) I can't exclude some modules that I don't
want to include, e.g. Perl core modules which should always already be
available.

Thus, here are the differences of B<fatten> compared to B<fatpack>:

=over

=item * A simpler interface and some nice defaults

Using B<fatten>, you only need a single step to produce the final result.

Currently B<fatten> ignores C<fatlib/> and XS modules. It only focuses on
creating free-standing Perl script which depends on pure-Perl modules (C<.pm>
files) only. Including C<fatlib/> to a stand-alone script will require an
approach like L<PAR::Archive> (i.e. bundling the required files in an archive
and extracting the required files into a temporary directory).

By default B<fatten> skips Perl core modules. This results in a smaller product.

B<fatpack> sometimes fails to include some modules because it can't find the
C<.packlist> for said modules. B<fatten> goes ahead and tries the next best
thing which is to copy just the C<.pm> files.

=item * Alternative methods to trace script's dependencies

There are various methods of tracing a script's dependencies, each with their
own pro's and con's. B<fatpack> checks C<%INC> in the C<CHECK> phase, and this
misses modules loaded during run-time using C<require>. Other methods include:
trapping C<require> (but this can also miss modules loaded conditionally
depending on execution path), static analysis using L<Perl::PrereqScanner> (this
can also miss some modules loaded in unusual ways).

B<fatten> uses L<App::tracepm>, which provides various methods of tracing. See
App::tracepm documentation for more details.

Of course, like B<fatpack>, you can also specify additional modules to include.
And, unlike B<fatpack>, you can specify modules to exclude as well.

=item * Some extra options

Like an option to strip/squish the module source codes with L<Perl::Strip>
(C<--strip>) or L<Perl::Stripper> (C<--stripper>) or L<Perl::Squish>
(C<--squish>).

=item * Configuration file support

See L</"CONFIGURATION FILE"> for more details.

=head1 append:CONFIGURATION FILE

Profiles are also automatically matched to the name of the script being
processed, if not specified. For example:

 [profile=parse-id-phone]
 trace_method=require
 #overwrite=1
 include=Parse::PhoneNumber::ID
 include=Perinci::CmdLine::Lite
 include=Data::Check::Structure
 include=Text::Table::Tiny

which will automatically be used when you fatten a script named
C<parse-id-phone>.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<App::FatPacker>

For producing free-standing Perl scripts/applications, there are other
alternatives like L<PAR::Packer> (can also pack XS modules and compress the
included files in a special archive, but with higher startup time and temporary
directory to extract stuffs).

L<Perl::Stripper>
